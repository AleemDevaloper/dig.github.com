       The peaks of the Rocky Mountains once projected as islands from a vast inland sea whose waves swept from the Gulf of Mexico to the polar ocean. In this era of the world a tropical climate extended far beyond the arctic circle, and the tepid waters swarmed with sea serpents and other reptilian monsters. At the close of this period, known to geologists as the cretaceous, a slow upheaval drained this ocean from the continent, and left behind great lakes, whose shores and waters teemed again, in tertiary time, with new forms of tropical life. Rhinoceros, crocodiles, and huge tortoises basked upon the banks or lay beneath the shade of gigantic palms; and as the ages rolled away prolific nature brought upon the scene the mammoth, mastodon, and horse. During the tertiary period mud and sand accumulated in the lakes to the depth of many hundred feet, and entombed the bones of all these animals. Then came a time when all was dry, and torrents from the mountains wore through the deep accumulations. Ages have passed since then, while rains and streams have toiled to wash away the work of all the prior years; and in the crumbling bluffs that now remain as memorials of the past the patient geologist may find the petrified remains of all the forms of life belonging to that early time.
       To the region of these eroded basins Professor O. C. Marsh, of Yale College, had long contemplated a geological expedition; and in June, 1870, he organized, from graduates and students of that university, the party to which it was the writer's privilege to belong.
       Our first exploration was to be made along the Loup Fork River, in Nebraska. We started from Fort M'Pherson escorted by a company of cavalry; for this was the country of the Sioux, and they were now in a state of unusual excitement. Across an unexplored desert of sand hills between the river Platte and the Loup Fork the celebrated Major North, with two Pawnee Indians, undertook to lead us. These guides rode about a mile in advance of the column. The major pointed out the least difficult paths; while the Indians crept up each high bluff, and from behind a bunch of grass peered over the top for signs of hostility. Next in the line of march came the company of cavalry, commanded by Lieutenants Reilly and Thomas; and with them rode the Yale party, mounted on Indian ponies, and armed with rifle, revolver, geological hammer, and bowie knife. Six army wagons, loaded with provisions, forage, tents, and ammunition, and accompanied by a small guard of soldiers, formed the rear.
       The object of the expedition greatly puzzled our military companions of the rank and file; but Professor Marsh, as we rode along, endeavored to explain to them the mighty changes of geology, and the grand discoveries that we would make. "Buffalo Bill," the famous frontier hunter, accompanied us the first day's journey, and at the camp fire that night remarked to the soldiers, "The professor told the boys some mighty tough yarns today; but he tipped me a wink, as much as to say. 'You know how it is yourself, Bill!'"
